                    <p> Short story about "Shibliy ata"
					<br> A man goes to Tajimahal. Someone comes up to you and asks where you came from. He replied that he was from Kegeyli district of Karakalpakstan. He then asks him if he has gone to the Shibli ata shrine. He replies, "No." Then why didn't you go here first, because it is said that visiting Shibli ata is the same as visiting Tajimahal.<br>
